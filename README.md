My Nerd Story Dot Com
==================

This repo contains the site at [http://mynerdstory.com](http://mynerdstory.com/) (a project by Crystal Beasley to tell the origin stories of women in tech ).

Gratitude goes to the team at [ZURB](http://zurb.com/) for their excellent [Foundation CSS framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/); [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) for the fantastic icon font; Pascal Finette for [The Heretic](http://theheretic.me), which I forked to make this.

Note to self: Images are multiples of 768x600 or 768x400.
