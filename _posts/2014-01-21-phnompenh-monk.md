I was busy framing up the shot on the right when one of the monks sitting on the steps asked me what I was doing. I must've taken forty shots of this tower of incense sticks trying to capture the gradations from the red of the unburned incense to the white of its ash. I showed him the LCD display on the back of my camera, and we agreed they looked like fireworks. His name was Kimlorn, which he said means "alone" thought he wasn't an only child. He insisted I take a photo of the more senior monk with the serious face, Houkimarn, who was so famous that people from all over Cambodia travelled to see him.
