One street is filled with dozens of pharmacies next to another, the next is all shops with everything you could want made of wicker, the next street is nothing but wholesale sugar cane. In Cambodia, like many other places in Asia, businesses of the same type tend to cluster around each other. Finding competitive prices and a comprehensive selection is as easy as walking from one end of the street to the other. The road I lived on, Street 178, is filled with shops that sell stone figurines and paintings. 

Seven days a week this young woman greeted me when I walked downstairs. She split her time between pounding spices and vegetables for they day's curry and sitting outside with a simple chisel carving an intricate tradition pattern onto a jar made of the dull green indigenous stone. Public schools, meager though they be, are available at no charge throughout Cambodia. I don't know why she wasn't in one. I do know her situation is typical as only 21% of kids make it to upper secondary school.
