title: Pork + Sun = Food | Kampot

Kampot is a tiny little town up the river a few kilometers away from the Gulf of Thailand. In the same way that "Champagne" means both a region in France and a lovely quaff, Kampot is synonymous with pepper. In the 1930's French chefs would only use pepper from Kampot.

I didn't find much of interest, so I rented a bike and peddled into the country where I found this. I'm with Socheta here on the wisdom of making sun-dried jerky on your handy fencepost. I consumed some bison jerky that was made in much the same fashion, and it was delicious. However, I can't get my mind and mouth around the idea that you hang fresh sausages in the sun to cure them. Just. Can't. Do. Eet.
