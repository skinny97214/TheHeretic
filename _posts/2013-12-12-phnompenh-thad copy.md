The sign says David's Hand Pulled Noodles but to me and my office mates it's Dirty Dave's. For only $2.75 (Yes, dollars. Cambodia mostly uses dollars instead of it's own currency the riel.) ...this young guy will hand-make a bowl of Chinese saimen noodle soup one at a time. His worktable fronts the sidewalk to draw people in with his flamboyant show. He starts with a soft, white lump of dough and kneads it out into a log shape. Then he oils it to keep it from sticking to itself. Now the folding process starts. Each time it's folded the number of noodles doubles. He twirls, stretches, twists, folds. Finally, the noodles get a trim down to size and are tossed in the big pot of broth. It's served up with bok choy, raw garlic and chili oil to taste.
