			<p>There is a shortage of women working in tech.  This is not due to genetic predisposition, but a lack of role models and a cultural lore that women can't code.</p>
			<p>
			My Nerd Story is a project dedicated to highlighting the ladies of tech and the diverse paths that brought us here.  We are coders, founders, CEOs, hobbyists sharing our stories in hopes of inspiring the next generation of women in technology. </p>
			<p>Join the My Nerd Story project!</p>			
			<p><strong>Read</strong> inspiring stories from a diverse group of women in tech from different ethnic, economic, educational and cultural backgrounds.</p>			
			<p><strong>Write</strong> your nerd story and become a role model, countering the misconceptions and stereotypes that hold many of us back.</p>
			<p><strong>Share</strong> this project with friends, family and colleagues -- especially with the young women and men who are the hope for a more gender-balanced future tech sector!</p>
